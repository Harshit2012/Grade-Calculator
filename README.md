## Syncing Your Fork
To sync your fork with the original repository, you’ll need to add the original repository as an upstream remote:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Harshit2012/Grade-Calculator.git
 ```

Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository:
```bash
git fetch upstream
```

Check out your fork’s local default branch - usually main:
```bash
git checkout main
```

Merge the changes from the upstream default branch - usually main:
```bash
git merge upstream/main
```

Now, your local default branch is up-to-date with the original repository’s default branch.

## Usage
Enter the marks for each subject in the provided input fields and click the ‘Calculate’ button. The application will display the average percentage and whether you have passed or failed.
